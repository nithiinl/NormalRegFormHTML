        <dt>1. Crowd Counting Method Based on CNN</dt>
        <dd>This application is developed for counting the total people in an image or
            video. It will give the total head count of people present in that image or video. The
            accuracy is 88%, mostly it gives correct results but in some scenarios it will give some
            inaccurate count. so by analysing the crowd we can take appropriate measures. It is
            developed using Python.</dd>
